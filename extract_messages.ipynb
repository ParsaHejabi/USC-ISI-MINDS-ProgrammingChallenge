      "i have made multiple purchase of cro for well over 4k each. I have persuaded my family members to buy all for well over 4k each. We have now in total purchased around $30k in cro. All of us have different banks. We were all charged fees for $120 per transaction because the app charges what is supposed to be in USD but instead charges in Euro or another currency apparently... our US Banks then charged us fees for currency exchanges. why has crypto.com not partnered with a bank or a financial firm or a merchant to resolv this issue. We are litterally throwing money out the window just to buy CRO. It is not because our \"banks\" charge international fees. It is because you say you charge USD when you're charging an equivalent in another currency.\n",

I turned my phone off and on again and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app. When I went to log in my email address came up as an error and I was told to contact support. I did so and have only had one message telling me to read the help forum. My Crypto.com DeFi wallet is still attached to my exchange app and shows the right email. I don’t know why the app won’t accept my credentials and hopefully some advice or help that they can share with me. I have not had access to trading on the platform since Tuesday. I would really like to be able to access my account, top up my card and use the exchange. Thanks for any assistance!\n",

Karoline wrote my on Friday morning (5/7) and told me if the forum did not resolve my issue to write back and within 24 hours I would hear back. I checked the forums, did nothing find an answer that could make the app recognize my credentials again, and wrote Karoline back. I have not heard anything back.

I did so and at first it was declined by my bank. So I informed my bank it was legit and tried again and it went through. The $400 was taken from my account, but I received no CRO and also received no confirmation emails about the purchase of CRO or anything about the card. I am confused. I went ahead and tried a small $20 purchase of CRO afterwards and it went through with no issues, got the $20 CRO and confirmation email. So now I'm out $400 with no CRO or ruby steel card confirmation. Somebody please let me know how to fix this. I've tried reaching out to crypto.com on their in app chat with no response. I tried the telegram and it kept asking me to solve an equation to write anything. It wouldn't go through and eventually they just blocked me from the Telegram.
