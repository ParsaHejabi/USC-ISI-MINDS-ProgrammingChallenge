I understand regarding the possibility of a node op having too much voting power@ but that wouldnt happen if there was a minimum staking reguirement for the 28 day hold to take effect. Obviously if you staked for 6 months then having to wait 28 days to unstake and not receiving staking rewards for that period is not very user friendly. Especially if you wanted to add a more coins.

payment 1 and 4 were billed and cashbacked instantly, whereas I have yet not gotten my cashback for payment 2 and 3. They also got only billed, when I moved the 4. payment, before moving the 4. they got ""stucked"" (waited 15 mins and nothing happened)

The merchants do give cashback, I already got some the last times I bought at them.

Should I just wait longer or contact the support in app?

I will freely admit that I’m relatively new to the market and don’t have a ton of money in there, but I will also say as i scale up, Repeated events like this very much damage my confidence in the app, and I’m likely to move my holdings to a different exchange.  

There’s no room for this kind of event over and over when the market gets busy. It’s one thing when my loss is 500 bucks and another when I go in enough that it could be 5000.  I really like the interface but I have to give you the feedback that right now I would be scared to upgrade my card and invest a large amount based on technical failures when the market gets busy"

I have looked into it and other people have had same issues with this particular authenticator. I’m not stupid and I know what I set up. I’m not the only one with this issue. I was told by someone with Crypto.com that they could reset the 2FA. The problem is nobody is responding now and it’s been 7 days!

For further explanation, you can break the code “CRO St Julians MLT” in the following ways:

CRO = Cryptocom - Merchant

St Julians = Merchant’s city

MLT = City’s country - Malta

There are 2 types of platforms for crypto trading - exchanges and Dexes.

You have crypto liquidity when you store your keys in exchanges and better security when in wallets.

There is another category called Decentralised exchanges or Dexes which are good for trading directly from a wallet"

As i understand you can buy from crypto.com wallet/app and transfer the fund to exchange. in that my qureies being is it better to directly buy the coin (say xrp) and transfer to exchange OR buy usdt/usdc , transfer that to exchange and convert to xrp inside the exchange (assuming this is possible)"
15044,en,0.999997424295374,Depends mainly on the transfer fee of the crypto from the wallet to exchange 🤔. You'll have to calculate if it's lower for the crypto you want to trade or the stablecoin.

Does CDC find it acceptable to continue to accept new visa applications, while users often report waiting in excess of 3 months, over 4 months in some cases for shipments of the cards?

I find such a time window unacceptable, made even more unacceptable when no such disclaimer has been made regarding the extreme wait time.

As of now I have no idea if my card will ship next week, or in 3.5 months from now.

If you are in the US and you use your debt card to fund your account instead of ACH, you will be charged the 2.99% even if it is less than 30 days since you joined crypto.com. The reason is that crypto.com account that money is transferred to for funding your account with them is a foreign account, and your bank will likely charge you international processing fee. I was charged over $375 and only managed to get $75  refunded. I wasted a long time on the phone questioning my bank on the charges.

US crypto.com customers, beware. It is not clear if you will not be charged too if you use ACH because the Metropolitan Bank details on their app is treated as a foreign account. Beware."

Does CDC find it acceptable to continue to accept new visa applications, while users often report waiting in excess of 3 months, over 4 months in some cases for shipments of the cards?

I find such a time window unacceptable, made even more unacceptable when no such disclaimer has been made regarding the extreme wait time.

As of now I have no idea if my card will ship next week, or in 3.5 months from now.

I turned my phone off and on again and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app. When I went to log in my email address came up as an error and I was told to contact support. I did so and have only had one message telling me to read the help forum. My Crypto.com DeFi wallet is still attached to my exchange app and shows the right email. I don’t know why the app won’t accept my credentials and hopefully some advice or help that they can share with me. I have not had access to trading on the platform since Tuesday.

Ps everyone : all exchanges and apps that are still semi new have traffic issues. Coinbase, binance,, kucoin ect all have had performance problems when they are new. They need time to work on things.

DOGE holders are now panick selling (It has dropped a lot since the end of SNL, Elon failed, really hard), ETH and BTC are stalling, and easy money come from high volatility, expectation, and shitcoins. 

The ones that are selling DOGE are coming here, my guess is DOGE is going to fall a little, still Top 10 Capitalization, but its revenues are coming here in SHIB, which is sure pumping a little, but it's all DOGE money, we are literally killing DOGE and SHIB is standing to its nickname, 0.0001 is highly possible in the next 48 hours, with the expectation of SHIBASWAP opening!

24008,en,0.9999951979942396,"Biggest opportunity right now in crypto is LTO/LTO Network. Look it up. Top 15 in blockchains based on actual transaction volume (all from actual BUSINESSES using the network). They’re a B2B (business-to-business) oriented crypto, and clients include the United Nations, Dutch government, IBM, and long list of other serious clients. All who are actually using the LTO Network right now. Compare that to other cryptos that aren’t even being used by anyone in the real world.

On top of that, when you own the LTO token you can stake/lease your coins to nodes/servers in order to help the network verify the transactions on the blockchain.  And for you doing that, you get 7% INTEREST payed to you by all these businesses using the network. And it gets better. As more and more businesses hop on LTO, this creates higher transaction volume which also increases our interest! 10%, 20%, and even higher APY are possible as more and more businesses jump on LTO.

I did so and at first it was declined by my bank. So I informed my bank it was legit and tried again and it went through. The $400 was taken from my account, but I received no CRO and also received no confirmation emails about the purchase of CRO or anything about the card. I am confused. I went ahead and tried a small $20 purchase of CRO afterwards and it went through with no issues, got the $20 CRO and confirmation email. So now I'm out $400 with no CRO or ruby steel card confirmation. Somebody please let me know how to fix this. I've tried reaching out to crypto.com on their in app chat with no response. I tried the telegram and it kept asking me to solve an equation to write anything. It wouldn't go through and eventually they just blocked me from the Telegram.

 We're experiencing delays in processing Support inquiries due to increased requests.

The team is aware of delayed cashback rewards for our Visa Cards, and delayed in-app crypto purchases. Please wait up to 48 hours for transactions to settle before reaching out to us.

ℹ If you're writing to Support, keep your communication in one message. Do not initiate multiple conversations, as this increases the delay in response time. 

Our teams are doing their best to respond as soon as possible and are working to make our infrastructure resistant to traffic peaks 💪

There are tokens with low liquidity which results in a wider spread. Try making your trades in smaller chunks rather than selling it all in one go to reduce the spread. 

If you have access to the Crypto.com Exchange, use the Exchange to set limit orders instead. That way, you can control the spread and set the price you wish per token.

Is it me or the Crypto.com app has not been working since the recent update. Its deposit and withdraw page as well as the buy and sell page is blank see below image and completely not working respectively. what the hell is going with this company, so much issues recently and I only started to use them for the past two months!!! Scrolling through the page, same experience with the customer service, takes two plus days to even get a response and they are less than helpful as they don't even read your message and seems like just copying and pasting their standard response template. Now I can't even get my money out as nothing is working on the app."

32527,en,0.9999976642548689,Agreed!  I ordered my Jade card about 4 months ago and have still not received it yet although the status has said shipped for almost 3 months. Then i was in talks for a resend which i was told had to go through approval over a month ago. 💆🏾.  Such an awesome project but Gaaaaaawd!  The support is terrible. Recently i began buying gift cards to get cro rewards since i dont have the card.  Amazon...fine Lowes...fine Home depot ...fine then i got to Ebay who flagged me over a $200 gift card demanding all this proof of purchase. Provided them with confirmations i got from Crypto.com and they said its not enough. Contacted crypto.com support over a week ago to see if i can return the gift cards and....Nothin.  So I'm basically stuck with ebay gift cards i can't use and no support. 😐.  Sorry for the rant guys but I needed to get this out. 💚

Our extreme levels of traffic over the last few days brought down one of payment infrastructure vendors. The result was that a number of users didn’t receive the crypto they bought.

Rest assured: If you bought crypto with a card in the last few days, you will receive it.

Our team is working around the clock to sort it out — expected ETA for the backfill of these missing credits is 3 hours. It’s a lot of data to go through, that’s why it took so long.

For instance, there are tokens with low liquidity which results in a wider spread. Try making your trades in smaller chunks rather than selling it all in one go to reduce the spread. 

If you have access to the Crypto.com Exchange, use the Exchange to set limit orders instead. That way, you can control the spread and set the price you wish per token. 

However, do note that for limit orders, you will need to wait for your order to fill, and it may take a while to fill if no one is selling at your price. Trades on the App are instant."

Total newbie to crypto here- I recently bought $500 ETH and plan on holding on to it while adding more down the line. 

My partner has a friend who spends all day watching charts and investing in 'shit' coins, he'd like to take $400 of our funds to invest in these coins to try and flip. I'm apprehensive and would like to know if it's a worthwhile investment. While $400 isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things, I'd be annoyed if we lost it dealing with someone he trusts wholeheartedly and who in turn is requesting 50% of whatever gains we receive (if any)"

One question-all say it is soo free, so decentralized and sooo for people, sooo open source but as far as I read using something like uniswap (dex) is super expensive and has no sense for small investment. I heard about ca. 25 dollars for a transfer and like 200 $ for swap. I dont ubderstand the difference between transer and swap but it seems it has absolutely no point to use it instead of normal exchanges where fees are low? So why so much hype about it?

Do not expect to be able to receive any type of reasonable service from crypto.com if you are experiencing serious problems with your account.

Do not hold much with them unless you don’t mind the potential of losing access to your account for a long period of time with absolutely no ability to have anyone look after your problems. If this happened at the start of a bear market you would be powerless to do anything about it. 

There is not a single phone number nor any specific part of the business you can contact.
You will not get assigned any individual and the following person will not read your case. In fact I’m not sure if many of the responses even come from Humans.

Its been 24 days since my account has been locked along with all my funds. Now all I get is the most impersonal email responses having no relation to my account. Apart from the 3 emails dating back over 2 weeks saying your info has been sent to the right place. One even said my account should be open in the next few days but then when chased a week later it was like none of the previous emails existed. 
One a few days ago said we have now sent it to the right people. When I sent one back saying you said that 2 weeks ago I didn’t get a response. In fact it’s pretty much been like that the whole time. The previous correspondence never gets read and you feel like a piece of shit on their shoe. This is the most impersonal, frustrating, sickening experience Me and my family have ever had to go through."

Also it’s not so much what you buy but where you buy. The CRO restriction on cashback generally relate to merchant codes and not what exactly you buy.

In general though anything that is ‘stuff/things you can hold’ you will more likely than not receive cashback. Things you cannot like insurance/financial products aren’t. Hope this makes sense I rambled a bit."

It's early days for that.

Also more adoption on other exchanges would see the price grow.

However, from speaking to staff in the UK CDC chat I don't think binance will come.

Inevitably CDC are not bothered what the value is, it is just a currency and it has sold nearly £3bn worth.

For me it's a no go. But I wish it well."

And compared to most others your fees are very reasonable as are withdrawl speeds.It is the best exchange out there overall. If you wouldn't mind passing this along to the staff I'm sure it's not easy dealing with all this. And thought you might like to hear that most of us appreciate all you do. 😁
